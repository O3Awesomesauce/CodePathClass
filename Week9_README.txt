•	Which Honeypot(s) you deployed
Ubuntu-Dionaea with HTTP
Ubunto-WordPot

•	Any issues you encountered

Set up issues were a problem. I was unable to get my SDK CMD prompt on my local machine to work correctly, so I configured the VMs using the cloud shell instance. Exporting the data was also complicated by this, I had to work on this for over an hour to figure out the project and permission configurations were correct. Also just as I was exporting the data, my MHN admin console in the browser crashed and needs to be reestablished. I am unsure if this was a fluke or due to my attempts at exporting the data files. 

•	A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
The majority of attacks used were pcaps. There were some SipCalls and SipSessions used as well. My overall number of attacks were 2,693 attacks. 

•	Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected
I would like to be able to set up some more honeypots and see if I could get any malware samples. I also would like to be able to trace back those locations and see where those attacks came from based on the IP.
